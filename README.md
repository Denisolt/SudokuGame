# SudokuGame
Sudoku game built on Java. Created this game on a flight from Moscow to New York. 

From Wiki:
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. 
The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, 
and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "subsquares")
contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, 
which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique solution.
